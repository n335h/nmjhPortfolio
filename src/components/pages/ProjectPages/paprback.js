          <p>
            Paprback is a book review website that allows users to
            search for books and leave reviews. Users can also view
            other users' reviews and leave comments on them. The
            website also has a forum where users can post topics and
            comment on them. The website also has a chatroom where
            users can chat with each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role in this project was to create the chatroom and the
            forum. I used Socket.io to create the chatroom and MongoDB
            to store the messages. I used MongoDB to store the forum
            topics and comments. I used Mongoose to create the schemas
            for the forum topics and comments. I used React to create
            the forum and chatroom pages. I used Node.js and Express
            to create the server. I used Heroku to deploy the website.
